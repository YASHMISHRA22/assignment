I use following dependencies for backend :
    "bcryptjs"-It is used for encryption of user credentials and also adding salt for more secure encryption ,
    "dotenv"-It is used to read .env file for important information like JWT Secret,PORT,Mongodb_URL,
    "express"-It is used to create backend in nodejs,
    "jsonwebtoken"-It is used for authentication ,
    "mongodb"- It is no sql document based database which store data in the form of bson similar to json which is highly efficient and easily scalable,
    "mongoose"-It is a middleware used to connect nodejs backend with mongodb database,
    "nodemon"-It is used to automatically re-render backend whenever we make any changes and save that.
Thunderclient is used to test restapi
